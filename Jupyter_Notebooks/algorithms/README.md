# Overview

This folder contains the algorithms, explorations, problems, and curios all related or found within the textbook *Introduction to Algorithms: 3rd Ed.*  The purpose of this folder is to enrich my understanding of algorithms, while exploring the application of higher level computational theory in the real world.  The long-term goal of this work is to help me prepare myself for the various problems that I will ultimately face as a coder and also as a human being.  

# Outline

Each folder will be created for a specific chapter in the book, and will contain all the algorithms, problems, and further personal explorations relating to that chapter.
